# viit (View Image In Terminal)
Most ridiculous way to view an image

### Usage

`viit <image>`

### Issues

- Only supports true color terminal
- If terminal aspect ratio doesn't match image, it will warp the image

### Future plans
- [ ] Add support for 256, 16 and 8 color mode
- [ ] Fix aspect ratio issue
- [ ] Make this readme better
